Cluster backup and recovery 
================================================

On the cluster backup and recovery page, you can view the basic information, details, and strategies of backup and recovery of the current cluster. 

**Procedure** 
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** . The cluster overview page appears.

   

3. Find the target cluster in the **Clusters** list and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

   

4. In the left-navigation pane, click **Backup \& Recovery** .

   On the Backup \& Recovery page, you can:
   * Click **Initiate Recovery** to recover the cluster. For more information, see [Initiate a recovery](../9.backup-and-restoration/6.initiate-a-recovery-task.md).

     
   
   * Click **Back up Now** to back up the cluster. For more information, see [Back up now](../9.backup-and-restoration/4.back-up-now.md).

     
   
   * If no backup strategy is created for the cluster, click **New Backup Strategy** to create a backup strategy for the cluster. For more information, see [Create a backup strategy](../9.backup-and-restoration/3.create-a-backup-strategy.md).

     
   
   * If a backup strategy has been created for the cluster, click **...** in the upper-right corner and select **Modify Backup Strategy** to modify the backup strategy. For information about the backup strategy parameters, see [Create a backup strategy](../9.backup-and-restoration/3.create-a-backup-strategy.md).

     
   
   * If a backup strategy has been created for the cluster, click in the upper-right corner and select **Delete Backup Strategy** to delete the backup strategy.

     
   
   * If a backup strategy has been created for the cluster, click **Pause** to pause the scheduling of automatic backup tasks for the cluster.

     
   
   * View the basic information of the cluster in fields such as **Status, Backup Method, Backup File, Last Data Backup Time, Log Backup Checkpoint, Log Delay, Scheduling History of Data Backup** , and **Scheduling History of Second Log Backup** .
