   > **Note**
   >
   > * In the **Current Value** column, a value followed by **(Cluster)** takes effect at the cluster level. As shown in the preceding figure, the current value of **backup_region** is **0 (Cluster)** , which indicates that the value 0 takes effect at the cluster level.
   > * In the **Current Value** column, a value followed by **(Custom)** does not take effect at the cluster level. For example, **2d;1d (Custom)** indicates that the value **2d** applies to a specific zone and the value **1d** applies to a specific OBServer. You can click each value to view the object to which it applies.
