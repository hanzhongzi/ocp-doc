   * Add objects that are accessible to the user: Click **Add Object** . In the dialog box that appears, specify the following information:

     |    Parameter     |                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                          |
     |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | Object Type      | Available options: **Table** , **View** , and **Stored Procedure** .  Note that you can add only one type of objects at a time. To add different types of objects, you need to add them separately.                                          |
     | Object           | You can select objects of other users, so that the user can access these objects.  You can paste one or more objects into the field in the format of "username.object name", such as schemaname.tablename. Separate objects with commas (,). |
     | Grant Permission | Select the privileges as needed. For more information, see [System privileges](../../15.appendix-2/11.list-of-system-permissions.md).                                                                                                                                 |

     After the accessible objects are added, the user can access and perform operations on these objects within the granted permissions.

   * Delete objects:

     * Delete an object: In the **Accessible Objects** list, locate the row that contains the target object, and click **Delete** in the Actions column.

     * Batch delete objects: In the **Accessible Objects** list, select the target objects, and click the **Batch Delete** .

     After an accessible object is deleted, the user can no longer access the object.
